## Installation

1. Download the project zip file from the GitHub repository and extract it.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd deel-homechallenge
   npm install

## Running the Scripts

1. Run `npm run seed` to seed the database before running the app.
2. Run `npm run start` to start the app.
3. Run `npm run test` to run the tests.

## Usage
